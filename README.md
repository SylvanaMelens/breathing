# 16 seconds breathing app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 

## The breathing app is deployed on Netlify

## Why this project?

As a patient severely affected by covid, the physiotherapist explained to me one way to practice breathing better. I had to imagine a square, 4 seconds of inspiration, 4 seconds of retention, 4 seconds of expiration, 4 seconds of blocking, and so on.

I found it hard to imagine, remember what action to do and count the seconds at the same time.

It is therefore with the aim of helping other people that this application was created.
